Blink on CH32v003 plus "fun"
==============================
Which obviously is not fun at all, but firmware size is a little better :

    496 bytes (ch32v003fun) 
    524 bytes (noneOS-SDK) 
    5,352 bytes (Arduino.h)

## * NOTE :
On error not found `funconfig.h`, it should have hinted to create one along `main.c` when using `ch32v003fun.h`.

Is this cheap-china `RISC-V` chip even worth investing time further ?
